# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
Cryptocurrency. With so many to choose from, how would one know how to invest in them? I was tasked by a client to create a report that shows what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market, and how they could be possibly grouped together to create a classification system. I will use unsupervised learning on these, then will gruop them together using the clustering algorithm. For this project, I will be using data retrieved from CryptoCompare
